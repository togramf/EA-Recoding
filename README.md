## pseudocode 
The artwork is based on a single algebraic curve (it looks symmetrical horizontally and vertically)

Place the origin in the center of the canva, 
draw the curve by placing vertices, it has 5 double loops above the center, for each loops, there is a wide and a narrow loop. 
The first loops near the origin are wider and small, and each loop is narrower and higher than the previous one. Dimensions are reduced or increased exponentially.
